## Description

The application is an elevator system call distribution algorithm with the ability
to configure the number of floors in the building and the number of elevators
with a graphical implementation of the movement of the elevator along the elevator
shaft. The elevator displays the direction of travel and the target floor.
On the target floor, it stops for 3 seconds and then continues on to the next call.
